                Recently I've been working with and thinking a lot about how people can better engage with 
                <a href="http://public-scrutiny-office.org">Parliament</a> and ways in which 
                <a href="http://rewiredstate.org/hacks/FCOhack2014">Foreign Office</a> data (and other global data sets) <a href="http://api.tinata.co.uk">can be leveraged</a>.

                Thanks to <a href="http://rewirestate.org">RewiredState</a> for inviting me to head up <a href="http://rewiredstate.org/hacks/nhtg14">National Hack The Government</a>
                in Scotland this year, and thanks to everyone who came - I had a great time and it was lovely to meet you all. Looking forward to #developneur in Paris!

                I'm interested in open software, open data (especially public sector data) and data driven journalism and how all three
                can improve our society. I'm happy writing code in several languages but I've been <a href="http://osrc.dfm.io/iaincollins">writing a lot in node.js recently</a>.
