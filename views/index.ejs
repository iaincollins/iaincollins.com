                Recently I've been working with and thinking a lot about how people can better engage with 
                <a href="http://feedback.public-scrutiny-office.org">Parliament</a> and ways in which 
                <a href="http://rewiredstate.org/hacks/FCOhack2014">Foreign Office</a> data (and other global data sets) can be leveraged.
            </p>

                I'm looking forward to being the center lead for <a href="http://rewiredstate.org/hacks/nhtg14">National Hack The Government 2014</a>
                in Scotland on the 8-9th March (if you can make it to Glasgow I'd love to see you there!)
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                I'm interested in open software, open data (especially public sector data) and data driven journalism and how all three
                can improve our society.
